**Instructions:**

Please complete all components described below.

**To submit:**

1. Clone your Week 6 Repo if you have not yet done so.

2. Create a new Quarto document. Title it "NAME_Lab6_Spring2026". 

3. At the very top of the document under title and author please be sure to put `embed-resources: true` AND `echo: true`. **This is a requirement each week!**

4. Complete all steps below.

5. Render and save. Make sure it is saved in the same folder as the RProject file for Week 6. 

6. Commit and Push.

**Remember:**

1.  Whenever you are using a package. You must open it. Remember `library()`. This must be in a code chunk in your document. 
2.  If you are using data, you must import it inside a code chunk. You cannot just use the import data button in the `Environment` pane. 
3.  Pay attention to your warnings and errors. They mean something.
  - Remember, ggplot requires a `+` sign, not the pipe.
4. Remember to `set.seed()`.

# Questions

## Part 1: The Normal Distribution

### Exercise 1

Use `rnorm()` to simulate 1,000 exam scores from a population with a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 10. Plot a histogram of your results and overlay a density curve. Does the shape look like what you'd expect? What happens if you change n to 50?

### Exercise 2

Use `dnorm()` to compute the density of the normal distribution at x = 70, 75, and 80, given mean = 75 and sd = 10. Plot the full density curve from x = 40 to x = 110. Which value has the highest density and why?

### Exercise 3

A standardized test has scores that are normally distributed with mean = 500 and sd = 100.

* What proportion of students scored below 450?
* What proportion scored above 650?
* What proportion scored between 400 and 600?

Hint: Use `pnorm()`

## Part 2: The Binomial Distribution

### Exercise 5

A multiple choice quiz has 20 questions, each with 4 answer choices. A student guesses randomly on every question.

* Use `dbinom()` to find the probability of getting exactly 5 correct.
* Plot the full probability mass function (all outcomes 0–20). What does the shape tell you?

### Exercise 6

Using `pbinom()`.

* What is the probability of getting 8 or fewer correct by guessing?
* What is the probability of getting more than 10 correct?
* Would getting 12 correct be surprising? Use a probability to support your answer.

## Part 3: The Poisson Distribution

### Exercise 7

A hospital emergency room receives an average of 8 patients per hour. This means lambda = 8 in the `Poisson` functions. (e.g., `dpois(x = COUNT, lambda = 8)`).

* Use `dpois()` to find the probability of receiving exactly 8 patients in a given hour.
* Find the probability of receiving fewer than 5 patients using `ppois().`
* Simulate 500 hours of arrivals using `rpois()` and plot the result.

## Part 4: The Uniform and Exponential Distribution

### Exercise 8

A bus arrives at a stop at a uniformly random time between 0 and 30 minutes after you arrive.
\
**This is the uniform distribution.** 

* Use `punif()` to find the probability you wait less than 10 minutes.
* Use `qunif()` to find the wait time that only 25% of riders experience or less.

### Exercise 9

The time between customer service calls follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 minutes (rate = 1/5). 
\
**This is the exponential distribution.** 

* Use `pexp()` to find the probability the next call arrives within 3 minutes.
* Use `qexp()` to find the time by which 90% of calls will have arrived.

## Part 5: Synthesis

Exercise 10: Simulate 10,000 data points using a distribution of your choosing. Find the 95% interval range (probs = 0.025-0.975) of your values. Plot the histogram, overlay a density, and label the minimum and maximum of your range.
